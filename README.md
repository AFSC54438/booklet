# Booklet
this repo contains a python program for rearranging pdf files into booklet format

a file in a booklet format is a file where when you print it double-sided and flip on short edge, u can fold it in such a way that it can be a booklet

booklet.py allows u to do that cuz apps that support print in booklet just suck

to ensure that this program works, make sure your directory follows this exact structure:
- booklet/
  - files_booklet/
  - files_upload/
  - app.py
  - booklet.py
  - empty.py
  - print.py

files_upload will contain pdf files that you wanna convert
files_booklet will contain converted pdf files
