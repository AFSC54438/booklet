# Booklet
this repo contains a python program for rearranging pdf files into booklet format

a file in a booklet format is a file where when you print it double-sided and flip on short edge, u can fold it in such a way that it can be a booklet

booklet.py allows u to do that cuz apps that support print in booklet just suck
